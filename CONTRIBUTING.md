Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the enhancement**
- **Describe the current behavior and expected behavior**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agentic-community.git
cd agentic-community
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Check style
flake8 . --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation

- Use docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
- Follow [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for docstrings
- Update the README.md if you change functionality

## Testing

We use pytest for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=agentic_community

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_agents.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Mock external dependencies (like API calls)
